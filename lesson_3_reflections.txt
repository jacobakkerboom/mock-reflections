Question: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work with other people!

Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You could reduce internet traffic if you do not always stay up-to-date. In
addition, you may have set up things so that somebody else can commit to the
remote and you might want to see what they have committed first.

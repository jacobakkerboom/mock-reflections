Question: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work with other people!

Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You could reduce internet traffic if you do not always stay up-to-date. In
addition, you may have set up things so that somebody else can commit to the
remote and you might want to see what they have committed first.

Question: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

The clone command copies a repository to a machine. You cannot clone a
reposity "into" Github. A fork copies a reposity on Github and handles some
details like incrementing a counter on the original repository that keeps
track on how often the repo was cloned. A branch is just a label for a
sequence of commits.
